  * 'method' keyword now only available by default in namespaces that consumed
    MooseSetup (Robert 'phaylon' Sedlacek).

  * Make anon classes immutable as well (unless explicitly asked not to).
  * Add a ctx method to add cleanup code that should be injected as early as

    immutalisation.

  * Add TODO tests for creating nested anonymous classes and roles
    (nperez).
  * Always end injected code with a semicolon.
  * Only do namespace nesting if the inner namespace starts with "::".
  * Depend on D::D 0.005001 to get a skip_declarator that doesn't fail
    when code is being compiled between calling the linstr callback and
    skip_declarator. This appears to be necessary to work on 5.8.
